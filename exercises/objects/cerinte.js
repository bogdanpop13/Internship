/* 
​
1. Write a function that list the properties of an object that 
has only 1 level of nesting
  Example: const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3} -> a , b , c
​
2. Given an object with 1 level of nesting, that has the values of the properties all numbers, write
a function that would make the sum of the values.
  Example: const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3} -> 6
​
3. Given a const user = {firstName: Vlad, lastName: Grecu, age: 23} define a method on the object "getUserFullName" 
that when called would
return the full name of the user 
​
4. Given an array of users const users = [{firstName: Vlad, lastName: Grecu, age: 23}, {firstName: Alex, lastName: Oancea, age: 17}]
 write a function that would
sort the array by age.
​
5. Write a JavaScript function to check whether an object contains given property.
const check = (obj, popertyToCheck) => { return true/false }  mai multe rez
​
6. Write a JavaScript function to convert an object into a list of `[key, value]` pairs. 
[['key1, val1'], ['key2, val2'] etc
​
7. Write a Javascript function to transform an object with `[key, value]` pairs into an array of objects. The array objects should be 
const array_obj = {[key]: random number, value_copy: value  }
​
8. Write a JavaScript function to get a copy of 
the object where the keys
 have become the values and the values the keys.
​
9. Write a Javascript function that checks the 
properties of an object and if they are falsy remove
 the property. Return the new object 
without the deleted properties

const example = {a: 2, b: undefined, c: "", d: "hello"} 
=> result = {a: 2, d: "hello"}
